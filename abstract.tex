\section*{Abstract} %TODO: Extend somehow
We design an authentication protocol that can be used to authenticate users over a network with a username and password.
The protocol uses the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) of quadratic residuosity protocol as a verification mechanism.
It is designed on top of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework as an EAP method.
The ZKP verification protocol yields interesting security properties that make the protocol favourable to be used over insecure networks.
