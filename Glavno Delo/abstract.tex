\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis we focus on designing an authentication system to authenticate users over a network with a username and a password.
The system uses the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system as a password verification mechanism.
The ZKP protocol used is based on the quadratic residuosity problem.
The authentication system is defined as a method in the extensible authentication protocol (EAP).
Using a ZKP system yields interesting security properties that make the system favourable to be used over insecure networks.
