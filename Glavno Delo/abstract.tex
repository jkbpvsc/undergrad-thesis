\section*{Abstract} %TODO: Extend somehow
We design an authentication system to authenticate users over a network with a username and a password.
The system uses the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) of quadratic residuosity as a password verification mechanism.
It is designed on top of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework as an EAP method.
The ZKP verification yields interesting security properties that make the system favourable to be used over insecure networks.
