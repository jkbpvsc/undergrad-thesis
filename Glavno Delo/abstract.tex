\section*{Abstract} 
We design an authentication system to authenticate users over a network with a username and a password.
The system uses the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system as a password verification mechanism.
The used zero-knowledge proof system based on the quadratic residuosity problem.
We define it as an authentication method in the extensible authentication protocol (EAP).
Using a ZKP system yields interesting security properties that make the system favourable to be used over insecure networks.
