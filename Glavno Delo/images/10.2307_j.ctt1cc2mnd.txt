 abstract = {The first translation into English of the standard work on the theory of numbers by one of the greatest masters of modern mathematical analysis, this classic was first published in 1801 in Latin. It has continued to be important to mathematicians as the source of the ideas from which number theory was developed and to students of the history of the electrical, astronomical, and engineering sciences, which were furthered by Gauss' application of his mathematical principles to these fields. Father Clarke has achieved a sympathetic and faithful translation of this monumental work. The book is complete and unabridged, and a bibliography of the references cited by Gauss has been added by the translator."Whatever set of values is adopted, Gauss'sDisquistiones Arithmeticaesurely belongs among the greatest mathematical treatises of all fields and periods. . . . The appearance of an English version of this classic is most welcome."-Asger Aaboe.},
