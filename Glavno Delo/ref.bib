abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

abstract="We have seen that the security of the RSA system and the Rabin system is closely connected to the difficulty of factoring a positive integer into primes. But it is not known whether the integer factoring problem is in fact difficult to solve. On the contrary, over the years many efficient integer factoring algorithms have been invented, and the number of digits required for secure RSA moduli has been increased from 512 to 1024 bits.",
