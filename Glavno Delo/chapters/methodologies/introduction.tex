\noindent
In this chapter we will explore the concepts and components behind our authentication system.
To design a password authentication system we must first understand what is an authentication system, how passwords work, and how to avoid their vulnerabilities.
We will also look into the EAP framework, on top of which we will be building our authentication system.
Our system will use a ZKP as a password verification mechanism, so we also examine what ZKPs are, how our ZKP protocol works, and the mathematics behind why it works.
