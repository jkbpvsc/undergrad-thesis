\noindent
In this chapter, we will explore the concepts and components behind our authentication system.
To design a password authentication system, we must first understand what an authentication system is, the mechanism of password based authentication, and how to avoid its vulnerabilities.
We will also look into the EAP framework, into which we will build our authentication system.
Our system will use a ZKP as a password verification mechanism, so we also examine what ZKPs are, how they work, and the mathematics behind why do they work.
