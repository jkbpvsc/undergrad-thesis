\noindent
In this chapter, we will explore the concepts and components behind our authentication system.
To design a password authentication system, we must first understand what an authentication system is, how passwords work, and how to avoid their vulnerabilities.
We will also look into the EAP framework, on top of which we will build our authentication system.
Our system will use a ZKP as a password verification mechanism, so we also examine what ZKPs are, how our ZKP protocol works, and the mathematics behind why it works.
