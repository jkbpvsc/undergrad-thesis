\chapter{System Architecture and EAP Method Definition}
\label{chapter:3}

\noindent 
In this chapter we will focus on the architecture of our authentication system and the definition of the EAP method.
In the first section we will examine how to utilise the ZKP protocol described in \S\ref{zkp-qrp} as a password verification method.
We need to be aware of the pitfalls 	of password authentication described in \S\ref{password-security-practices} and support necessary security practices.
In the second section we will define our authentication system as an EAP method in the EAP authentication framework described in \S\ref{section:eap}, by defining the messages and processes necessary for execution of our authentication system.
