\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we will focus on the design of our authentication system and the definition of the EAP method.

In the first section we will examine how to utilise the a ZKP protocol \S\ref{zkp-qrp} as a password verification method.
We need to be aware of the pitfalls 	of password authentication \S\ref{password-security-practices} and support necessary security practices.

In the second section we will define our authentication system design as an EAP \S\ref{section:eap}, by defining the messages and processes necessary for execution of our authentication system.
